				During these difficult times of the pandemic, where we are all compelled to social
				distance wherever we go and avoid crowded places as much as possible, it has become
				troublesome to get groceries done. As you may have seen, that these days only a specific
				number of people are allowed at one time inside a grocery or a convenience store, we’ve all
				been in a situation where we’ve waited long hours outside a store for our name to be called.
				This situation just gets worse on weekends because of the increase in the number of people
				visiting stores. The only way to avoid this is by online shopping, however not everybody can
				afford online shopping as it tends to get a little expensive. Hence, non-virtual shopping is the
				only affordable way to deal with this. In this case waiting inside our car or standing around the
				block for our turn to be called, is an inconvenience and waste of time.

			<p style="font-color: #ff9589; font-size: 18; font-family: Lucida Console, Courier, monospace;">
				Our team came up with this idea to ease the grocery shopping experience for customers
				and the business owners. Stores can publish their registration links online so people can sign up
				from their computer/phone.
				Our website “Quick-Line” (registration link) works in such a way that, there will be a
				randomly generated QR code in front of a grocery which could be scanned with either a
				customer’s phone or entered in the registration website. It will log the customer in and ask a
				few, quick details/questions for verifications and customer feedback; doing this will place the
				customer in a virtual line. When a number is called, the customer will be notified and now
				he/she has five minutes to show up and click “I’m here”, before their spot gets offered to the
				next customer waiting in line.
